# MWC-Module-3-Modular-Workflow-and-Project-Setup-Basics
# Problem Statement:
## Business Context:
The project aims to develop a machine learning system that predicts individua
l income levels based on demographic and employment data.
The prediction boundary is set at $50,000 annually (binary classification probl
em).
The solution will help in understanding socio-economic factors affecting inco
me levels.
Setting up the Project Repository 4
Enable data-driven decision making for policy makers and financial institution
s.
Identify key socio-economic factors influencing income disparities.
Support targeted intervention programs for economic development
## Key Stakeholders
**Policy Makers:** For evidence-based policy development
**Financial Institutions:** For risk assessment and product development
**Social Services:** For resource allocation and program planning
**Research Organizations:** For socio-economic studies
# Dataset Details:
Let's visualize the data structure and features:
